## About `sbi`

`sbi` is a PyTorch package for simulation-based inference. Simulation-based inference is the process of finding parameters of a simulator from observations.

`sbi` takes a Bayesian approach and returns a full posterior distribution over the parameters of the simulator, conditional on the observations.
The package implements a variety of inference algorithms, including _amortized_ and _sequential_ methods.
Amortized methods return a posterior that can be applied to many different observations without retraining; sequential methods focus the inference on one particular observation to be more simulation-efficient.


## Get started

To get started using `sbi` begin by reading the [Documentation](https://sbi-dev.github.io/sbi/).
